# Chord-Classifier
## Using machine learning to classify chords :)    

The `.ipynb` files contain our four models:
- Baseline ANN  
- 1D CNN  
- CNN with spectrogram input  
- Transfer Learning with ResNet  

We did most of our training in Google Colab to access their GPUs.

Our ANN and 1D CNN use the **chromagram** data of the audio files as input,  
while the CNN-spectrogram and Transfer Learning ResNet use **spectrogram** data (frequency/time).  

Does it make a difference?
