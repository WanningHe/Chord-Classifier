# Chord-Classifier
## Using machine learning to classify chords :)
The ipynb files contain our four models: baseline ANN, 1DCNN, CNN-spectrogram, and TransferLearningResnet. We did most of our training in Google Colab to access their GPUs. 
Our ANN and 1DCNN use the chromagram data of the audio files as input, while the CNN-spectrogram and Transfer Learning ResNet use the spectrogram data (frequency/time) of the audio files as input. Does it make a difference?
If you're interested in our results, take a look!
